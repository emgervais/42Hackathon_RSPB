# Bird Identification Chatbot

This project is a chatbot designed to help identify birds based on user descriptions. It allows users to describe a bird they've spotted, and the bot will attempt to identify it, providing the option to select from a list of possible matches.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:
```bash
cd <project_directory>
npm install
```

3. **Run the Development Server**
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Available Pages

At the moment, the app supports two pages:

    /chat: The main chat interface where users can describe a bird they spotted, and the chatbot will attempt to identify it.
    /result: After selecting or identifying a bird, users can view detailed information about the identified bird.

Note: The home page is not yet integrated, so users will be redirected to /chat directly.

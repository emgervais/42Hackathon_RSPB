They also eat seeds and berries, particularly in winter when insects are harder to find, and sometimes make the most of crumbs that have fallen from bird feeders. You might see one singing from an elevated perch. Males build several different nests in the nooks and crannies of trees, climbers, walls and banks. A female will inspect the various nest options before choosing one and lining it with feathers",

A male Wren will begin to build multiple nests from which the female bird will select her favourite. The female will begin working on lining her preferred nest, where she will lay five or six eggs on average. The male's extra efforts don\u2019t go to waste, as he will often raise multiple broods with multiple partners! ",
                "Fact 3": "For such a small bird, the Wren is loud, firing out its song like a flurry of high-pitched machine-gun fire. More than 100 notes can be crammed into a few seconds of linked trills, shrills and rattles.",
